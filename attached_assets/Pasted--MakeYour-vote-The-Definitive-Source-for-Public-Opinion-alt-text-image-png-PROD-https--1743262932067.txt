### Vision

MakeYour.vote is building the first standardized infrastructure for collective public opinion,
unifying fragmented sentiment into official, actionable data.

### Problem

Public sentiment is fragmented across endless biased sources, with no unified platform showing what
people truly think.

### Solution

MakeYour.vote unifies all votes into a single source of truth, making the collective sentiment
official & visible for all.
